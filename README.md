# Hello there !

My name is Don Chartier and I am a Boston area Data and Reporting Analytics expert who is passionate about creating information systems that drive and elevate people and business profitiability.   Some data technologies I enjoy working with include SQL, PowerBI, Excel, VBA, C#, Powershell, Access and all vaiants that comprise most data acquisition, transformation and presentation methodologies. Working with information as far upstream as possible has helped me develop autonmous reporting strategies that become self sustaining entities that update and present themselves with accracy and reliability without any user intervention.  

I've tried to highlight a few of my projects here to help show my process and approach to problem solving. 

It is my belief that just about any problem can be solved and answered depending on how you approach looking for the solution.  No solution is too small when it helps drive change. Sometimes you have to get up close and squint real hard, and sometimes you have to stand way back and use a magnifying glass.  That process is what drives my professionalism.  

I am building out my profile as time allows so please check back for future project information
